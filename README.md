# Czech My Pixels - Blog

Source code for the client side part of the [Czech My Pixels](http://czechmypixels.com) blog.

It is written in [isomorphic](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/react-to-the-future-with-isomorphic-apps/) [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), using [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) as the (predictable) state container and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as the bundler. It is meant to be fully responsive and while certain efforts have been made, I have not gone out of my way to optimize for older web browsers.
